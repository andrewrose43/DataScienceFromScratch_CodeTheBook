"""This chapter didn't lend itself to the creation of variant versions of its code - its code mostly comprises very
basic linear algebra utility functions. I shall, however, create a project for this chapter. In it, I plan to
recreate some more NumPy features and/or code some more advanced linear algebra operations, all with full TDD. I
might use one of Grus's recommended linear algebra textbooks for inspiration. (TODO) """
